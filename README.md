![](https://github.com/Prakashpsk/Predicting-Hotel-Booking-Cancellations-Building-a-Decision-Tree-Model/blob/main/Decision-Trees-Root-Node.png)


## Introduction
This repository contains code and documentation for building a decision tree model to predict hotel booking cancellations. The dataset used includes hotel bookings from July 2015 to August 2017, including both bookings that were canceled and those that were not.

## Skills/Concepts Developed
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Categorical data encoding
- Numerical data transformation
- Model evaluation
- Decision tree modeling
- Visualization

## Problem Statement
The objective is to develop a decision tree model that accurately predicts whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not based on various features such as booking lead time, guest demographics, booking channels, and special requests.

## Modeling
### Steps
1. Read the hotel dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to check data quality, handle missing values, etc.
3. Analyze categorical data and transform using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
4. Analyze numerical data and transform using power transform.
5. Scale the data.
6. Split the data into training and testing sets.
7. Apply the decision tree model.
8. Evaluate the model using performance metrics.
9. Visualize the decision tree.

## Visualization
Visualize the decision tree model to gain insights into its decision-making process.

## Conclusion

The project successfully built a decision tree model to predict hotel booking cancellations. The model achieved an ROC AUC metric > 1.0, indicating good performance.

## Recommendations
- Further feature engineering may improve model performance.
- Consider experimenting with different machine learning algorithms for comparison.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., Python, pandas, scikit-learn).
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the code.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook/script to perform data analysis and train the model.
